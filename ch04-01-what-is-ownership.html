                    <h2>What is Ownership?</h2>
<p>Rust’s central feature is <em>ownership</em>. It is a feature that is straightforward
to explain, but has deep implications for the rest of the language.</p>
<p>All programs have to manage the way they use a computer’s memory while running.
Some languages have garbage collection that’s constantly looking for no longer
used memory as the program runs, while in others, the programmer has to
explicitly allocate and free the memory. Rust takes a third approach: memory is
managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler
checks at compile-time. You do not pay any run-time cost for any of these
features.</p>
<p>Since ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take some time
to get used to. There is good news, though: the more experienced you become
with Rust and the rules of the ownership system, the more you’ll be able to
naturally develop code that is both safe and efficient. Keep at it!</p>
<p>Once you understand ownership, you have a good foundation for understanding the
features that make Rust unique. In this chapter, we’ll learn ownership by going
through some examples, focusing on a very common data structure: strings.</p>
<!-- PROD: START BOX -->
<blockquote>
<h3>The Stack and the Heap</h3>
<p>In many programming languages, we don’t have to think about the stack and the
heap very often. But in a systems programming language like Rust, whether a
value is on the stack or the heap has more of an effect on how the language
behaves and why we have to make certain decisions. We’re going to be
describing parts of ownership in relation to the stack and the heap, so here
is a brief explanation.</p>
<p>Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory that is available to your code
to use at runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores
values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order.
This is referred to as <em>last in, first out</em>. Think of a stack of plates: when
you add more plates, you put them on top of the pile, and when you need a
plate, you take one off the top. Adding or removing plates from the middle or
bottom wouldn’t work as well! Adding data is called <em>pushing onto the stack</em>
and removing data is called <em>popping off the stack</em>.</p>
<p>The stack is fast because of the way it accesses the data: it never has to
look around for a place to put new data or a place to get data from; that
place is always the top. Another property that makes the stack fast is that
all data on the stack must take up a known, fixed size.</p>
<p>For data with a size unknown to us at compile time, or a size that might
change, we can store data on the heap instead. The heap is less organized:
when we put data on the heap, we ask for some amount of space. The operating
system finds an empty spot somewhere in the heap that is big enough, marks it
as being in use, and returns to us a pointer to that location. This process
is called <em>allocating on the heap</em>, and sometimes we just say “allocating”
for short. Pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating. Since
the pointer is a known, fixed size, we can store the pointer on the stack,
but when we want the actual data, we have to follow the pointer.</p>
<p>Think of being seated at a restaurant. When you enter, you say how many people
are in your group, and the staff finds an empty table that would fit everyone
and leads you there. If someone in your group comes late, they can ask where
you have been seated to find you.</p>
<p>Accessing data in the heap is slower because we have to follow a pointer to
get there. Contemporary processors are faster if they jump around less in
memory. Continuing the analogy, consider a server at a restaurant who is
taking orders from many tables. It's most efficient to get all of the orders
at one table before moving on to the next table. Taking an order from table
A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, then one from B again
would be much slower. By the same token, a processor can do its job better if
it works on data that's close to other data (as it is on the stack), rather
than farther away (as it can be on the heap). Allocating a large amount of
space on the heap can also take time.</p>
<p>When our code calls a function, the values passed into the function
(including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s
local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those
values get popped off the stack.</p>
<p>Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap,
minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused
data on the heap so that we don’t run out of space—these are all problems
that ownership addresses. Once you understand ownership, you won’t need to
think about the stack and the heap very often, but knowing that managing heap
data is why ownership exists can help explain why it works the way it does.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Ownership Rules</h3>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the rules. Keep these in mind as we go through the
examples that will illustrate the rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its <em>owner</em>.</li>
<li>There can only be one owner at a time.</li>
<li>When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3>Variable Scope</h3>
<p>We’ve walked through an example of a Rust program already in the tutorial
chapter. Now that we’re past basic syntax, we won’t include all of the <code>fn main() {</code> stuff in examples, so if you’re following along, you will have to put
the following examples inside of a <code>main</code> function yourself. This lets our
examples be a bit more concise, letting us focus on the actual details rather
than boilerplate.</p>
<p>As a first example of ownership, we’ll look at the <em>scope</em> of some variables. A
scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid. Let’s say we
have a variable that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let s = &quot;hello&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>s</code> refers to a string literal, where the value of the string is
hard coded into the text of our program. The variable is valid from the point
at which it’s declared until the end of the current <em>scope</em>. That is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{                      // s is not valid here, it’s not yet declared
    let s = &quot;hello&quot;;   // s is valid from this point forward

    // do stuff with s
}                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
</code></pre>
<p>In other words, there are two important points in time here:</p>
<ul>
<li>When <code>s</code> comes <em>into scope</em>, it is valid.</li>
<li>It remains so until it <em>goes out of scope</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, things are similar to other programming languages. Now let’s
build on top of this understanding by introducing the <code>String</code> type.</p>
<h3>The <code>String</code> Type</h3>
<p>In order to illustrate the rules of ownership, we need a data type that is more
complex than the ones we covered in Chapter 3. All of the data types we’ve
looked at previously are stored on the stack and popped off the stack when
their scope is over, but we want to look at data that is stored on the heap and
explore how Rust knows when to clean that data up.</p>
<p>We’re going to use <code>String</code> as the example here and concentrate on the parts of
<code>String</code> that relate to ownership. These aspects also apply to other complex
data types provided by the standard library and that you create. We’ll go into
more depth about <code>String</code> specifically in Chapter 8.</p>
<p>We’ve already seen string literals, where a string value is hard-coded into our
program. String literals are convenient, but they aren’t always suitable for
every situation you want to use text. For one thing, they’re immutable. For
another, not every string value can be known when we write our code: what if we
want to take user input and store it?</p>
<p>For things like this, Rust has a second string type, <code>String</code>. This type is
allocated on the heap, and as such, is able to store an amount of text that is
unknown to us at compile time. You can create a <code>String</code> from a string literal
using the <code>from</code> function, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>The double colon (<code>::</code>) is an operator that allows us to namespace this
particular <code>from</code> function under the <code>String</code> type itself, rather than using
some sort of name like <code>string_from</code>. We’ll discuss this syntax more in the
“Method Syntax” and “Modules” chapters.</p>
<p>This kind of string <em>can</em> be mutated:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

s.push_str(&quot;, world!&quot;); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

println!(&quot;{}&quot;, s); // This will print `hello, world!`
</code></pre>
<p>So, what’s the difference here? Why can <code>String</code> be mutated, but literals
cannot? The difference comes down to how these two types deal with memory.</p>
<h3>Memory and Allocation</h3>
<p>In the case of a string literal, because we know the contents at compile time,
the text is hard-coded directly into the final executable. This makes string
literals quite fast and efficient. But these properties only come from its
immutability. Unfortunately, we can’t put a blob of memory into the binary for
each piece of text whose size is unknown at compile time and whose size might
change over the course of running the program.</p>
<p>With the <code>String</code> type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text,
we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time,
to hold the contents. This means two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The memory must be requested from the operating system at runtime.</li>
<li>We need a way of giving this memory back to the operating system when we’re
done with our <code>String</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That first part is done by us: when we call <code>String::from</code>, its implementation
requests the memory it needs. This is pretty much universal in programming
languages.</p>
<p>The second case, however, is different. In languages with a <em>garbage collector</em>
(GC), the GC will keep track and clean up memory that isn’t being used anymore,
and we, as the programmer, don’t need to think about it. Without GC, it’s the
programmer’s responsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and
call code to explicitly return it, just as we did to request it. Doing this
correctly has historically been a difficult problem in programming. If we
forget, we will waste memory. If we do it too early, we will have an invalid
variable. If we do it twice, that’s a bug too. We need to pair exactly one
<code>allocate</code> with exactly one <code>free</code>.</p>
<p>Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the
variable that owns it goes out of scope. Here’s a version of our scope example
from earlier using <code>String</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{
    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;); // s is valid from this point forward

    // do stuff with s
}                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
</code></pre>
<p>There is a natural point at which we can return the memory our <code>String</code> needs
back to the operating system: when <code>s</code> goes out of scope. When a variable goes
out of scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called
<code>drop</code>, and it is where the author of <code>String</code> can put the code to return the
memory. Rust calls <code>drop</code> automatically at the closing <code>}</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This pattern is sometimes called *Resource Acquisition Is
Initialization* in C++, or RAII for short. The <code>drop</code> function in Rust will be
familiar to you if you have used RAII patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pattern has a profound impact on the way that Rust code is written. It may
seem simple right now, but things can get tricky in more advanced situations
when we want to have multiple variables use the data that we have allocated on
the heap. Let’s go over some of those situations now.</p>
<h4>Ways Variables and Data Interact: Move</h4>
<p>There are different ways that multiple variables can interact with the same data
in Rust. Let’s take an example using an integer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let x = 5;
let y = x;
</code></pre>
<p>We can probably guess what this is doing based on our experience with other
languages: “Bind the value <code>5</code> to <code>x</code>, then make a copy of the value in <code>x</code> and
bind it to <code>y</code>.” We now have two variables, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and both equal <code>5</code>.
This is indeed what is happening since integers are simple values with a known,
fixed size, and these two <code>5</code> values are pushed onto the stack.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the <code>String</code> version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
let s2 = s1;
</code></pre>
<p>This looks very similar to the previous code, so we might assume that the way
it works would be the same: that the second line would make a copy of the value
in <code>s1</code> and bind it to <code>s2</code>. This isn’t quite what happens.</p>
<p>To explain this more thoroughly, let’s take a look at what <code>String</code> looks like
under the covers in Figure 4-1. A <code>String</code> is made up of three parts, shown on
the left: a pointer to the memory that holds the contents of the string, a
length, and a capacity. This group of data is stored on the stack. On the right
is the memory that holds the contents, and this is on the heap.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="String in memory" src="img/trpl04-01.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" />
<figcaption>
<p>Figure 4-1: Representation in memory of a <code>String</code> holding the value <code>&quot;hello&quot;</code>
bound to <code>s1</code></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the <code>String</code> is
currently using. The capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the
<code>String</code> has gotten from the operating system. The difference between length
and capacity matters but not in this context, so for now, it’s fine to ignore
the capacity.</p>
<p>When we assign <code>s1</code> to <code>s2</code>, the <code>String</code> data itself is copied, meaning we
copy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not
copy the data on the heap that the <code>String</code>’s pointer refers to. In other
words, it looks like figure 4-2.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="s1 and s2 pointing to the same value" src="img/trpl04-02.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" />
<figcaption>
<p>Figure 4-2: Representation in memory of the variable <code>s2</code> that has a copy of
<code>s1</code>’s pointer, length and capacity</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And <em>not</em> Figure 4-3, which is what memory would look like if Rust instead
copied the heap data as well. If Rust did this, the operation <code>s2 = s1</code> could
potentially be very expensive if the data on the heap was large.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
<p>Figure 4-3: Another possibility for what <code>s2 = s1</code> might do, if Rust chose to
copy heap data as well.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Earlier, we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust will
automatically call the <code>drop</code> function and clean up the heap memory for that
variable. But in figure 4-2, we see both data pointers pointing to the same
location. This is a problem: when <code>s2</code> and <code>s1</code> go out of scope, they will both
try to free the same memory. This is known as a <em>double free</em> error and is one
of the memory safety bugs we mentioned before. Freeing memory twice can lead to
memory corruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>In order to ensure memory safety, there’s one more detail to what happens in
this situation in Rust. Instead of trying to copy the allocated memory, Rust
says that <code>s1</code> is no longer valid and, therefore, doesn’t need to free anything
when it goes out of scope. Check out what happens when you try to use <code>s1</code>
after <code>s2</code> is created:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust,ignore">let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
let s2 = s1;

println!(&quot;{}&quot;, s1);
</code></pre>
<p>You’ll get an error like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">5:22 error: use of moved value: `s1` [E0382]
println!(&quot;{}&quot;, s1);
               ^~
5:24 note: in this expansion of println! (defined in &lt;std macros&gt;)
3:11 note: `s1` moved here because it has type `collections::string::String`, which is moved by default
 let s2 = s1;
     ^~
</code></pre>
<p>If you have heard the terms “shallow copy” and “deep copy” while working with
other languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length, and capacity
without copying the data probably sounds like a shallow copy. But because Rust
also invalidates the first variable, instead of calling this a shallow copy,
it’s known as a <em>move</em>. Here we would read this by saying that <code>s1</code> was <em>moved</em>
into <code>s2</code>. So what actually happens looks like Figure 4-4.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="s1 moved to s2" src="img/trpl04-04.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" />
<figcaption>
<p>Figure 4-4: Representation in memory after <code>s1</code> has been invalidated</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That solves our problem! With only <code>s2</code> valid, when it goes out of scope, it
alone will free the memory, and we’re done.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there’s a design choice that’s implied by this: Rust will never
automatically create “deep” copies of your data. Therefore, any <em>automatic</em>
copying can be assumed to be inexpensive.</p>
<h4>Ways Variables and Data Interact: Clone</h4>
<p>If we <em>do</em> want to deeply copy the <code>String</code>’s data and not just the <code>String</code>
itself, there’s a common method for that: <code>clone</code>. We will discuss methods in
the section on <a href="ch05-01-structs.html"><code>structs</code> in Chapter 5</a><!-- ignore -->, but they’re a
common enough feature in many programming languages that you have probably seen
them before.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the <code>clone</code> method in action:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
let s2 = s1.clone();

println!(&quot;s1 = {}, s2 = {}&quot;, s1, s2);
</code></pre>
<p>This will work just fine, and this is how you can explicitly get the behavior
we showed in Figure 4-3, where the heap data <em>does</em> get copied.</p>
<p>When you see a call to <code>clone</code>, you know that some arbitrary code is being
executed, and that code may be expensive. It’s a visual indicator that
something different is going on here.</p>
<h4>Stack-only Data: Copy</h4>
<p>There’s another wrinkle we haven’t talked about yet. This code, that we showed
earlier, works and is valid:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let x = 5;
let y = x;

println!(&quot;x = {}, y = {}&quot;, x, y);
</code></pre>
<p>This seems to contradict what we just learned: we don’t have a call to <code>clone</code>,
but <code>x</code> is still valid, and wasn’t moved into <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>This is because types like integers that have a known size at compile time are
stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick to make.
That means there’s no reason we would want to prevent <code>x</code> from being valid
after we create the variable <code>y</code>. In other words, there’s no difference between
deep and shallow copying here, so calling <code>clone</code> wouldn’t do anything
differently from the usual shallow copying and we can leave it out.</p>
<p>Rust has a special annotation called the <code>Copy</code> trait that we can place on
types like these (we’ll talk more about traits in Chapter 10). If a type has
the <code>Copy</code> trait, an older variable is still usable after assignment. Rust will
not let us annotate a type with the <code>Copy</code> trait if the type, or any of its
parts, has implemented the <code>Drop</code> trait. If the type needs something special
to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the <code>Copy</code> annotation to
that type, we will get a compile-time error.</p>
<p>So what types are <code>Copy</code>? You can check the documentation for the given type to
be sure, but as a rule of thumb, any group of simple scalar values can be Copy,
and nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource is <code>Copy</code>.
Here’s some of the types that are <code>Copy</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the integer types, like <code>u32</code>.</li>
<li>The boolean type, <code>bool</code>, with values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>All of the floating point types, like <code>f64</code>.</li>
<li>Tuples, but only if they contain types which are also <code>Copy</code>. <code>(i32, i32)</code> is
<code>Copy</code>, but <code>(i32, String)</code> is not.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ownership and Functions</h3>
<p>The semantics for passing a value to a function are similar to assigning a
value to a variable. Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just
like assignment. Here’s an example, with some annotations showing where
variables go into and out of scope:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);  // s comes into scope.

    takes_ownership(s);             // s’s value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here.
    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope.

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it’s okay to still
                                    // use x afterward.

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But since s’s value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope.
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope.
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
</code></pre>
<p>If we tried to use <code>s</code> after the call to <code>takes_ownership</code>, Rust would throw a
compile-time error. These static checks protect us from mistakes. Try adding
code to <code>main</code> that uses <code>s</code> and <code>x</code> to see where you can use them and where
the ownership rules prevent you from doing so.</p>
<h3>Return Values and Scope</h3>
<p>Returning values can also transfer ownership. Here’s an example with similar
annotations:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1.

    let s2 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3.
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope, and is dropped. s2 goes out of scope, but was
  // moved, so nothing happens. s1 goes out of scope, and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -&gt; String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it.

    let some_string = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;); // some_string comes into scope.

    some_string                              // some_string is returned, and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function.
}

// takes_and_gives_back will both take a String and return one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -&gt; String { // a_string comes into scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned, and moves out to the calling function
}
</code></pre>
<p>It’s the same pattern, every time: assigning a value to another variable moves
it, and when heap data values’ variables go out of scope, if the data hasn’t
been moved to be owned by another variable, the value will be cleaned up by
<code>drop</code>.</p>
<p>Taking ownership then returning ownership with every function is a bit tedious.
What if we want to let a function use a value but not take ownership? It’s
quite annoying that anything we pass in also needs to be passed back if we want
to use it again, in addition to any data resulting from the body of the
function that we might want to return as well.</p>
<p>It is possible to return multiple values using a tuple, like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!(&quot;The length of '{}' is {}.&quot;, s2, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -&gt; (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String.

    (s, length)
}
</code></pre>
<p>But this is too much ceremony and a lot of work for a concept that should be
common. Luckily for us, Rust has a feature for this concept: references.</p>
